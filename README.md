# 🔍 Terraform Business Insights (TFBI) 
> Business, Operational, and Adoption Insights for Terraform Cloud & Enterprise 

> Note: TFBI is a personal project and not associated with HashiCorp. 


**Summary:** Terraform Cloud Business Insights (TFBI) is a tool that provides business, operational, and adoption insights for Terraform Cloud/Enterprise operators. It implements both custom Prometheus collectors and metrics to query the Terraform Cloud/Enterprise API using [go-tfe](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-tfe) Go libary and a Grafana dashboard to easily explore common business, operational, and adoption metrics.

> Note: go-tfe and the TFC/TFE API provide much more endpoints/data that can be scraped beyond what is implemented in TFBI. Feel free to provide feedback/contributions. 

## Usage

0. Clone this repo. 
1. Create a [Terraform Cloud or Enterprise API Token](https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens)
2. Export your TFC/TFE API Token, name of organization(s), and the TFC/TFE API address:

```
export TF_API_TOKEN="TOKEN"
export TF_ORGANIZATIONS="ORG_NAME"
export TFE_ADDRESS="https://app.terraform.io"  # For TFE, substitute with TFE address instead
```

> NOTE: TFBI supports scraping multiple orgs, you can simply add the organization names as a list (e.g `TF_ORGANIZATIONS="ORG_1,ORG_2,ORG_3"` ) 

3. Spin up the application using Docker Compose

```

$ docker compose up -d

[+] Running 4/4
 ✔ Network tfbi_default         Created                                                           0.0s
 ✔ Container tfbi-grafana-1     Started                                                           0.0s
 ✔ Container tfbi-prometheus-1  Started                                                           0.1s
 ✔ Container tfbi-exporter-1    Started                                                           0.1s

```

4. Now you can access the dashboard using http://localhost:3000, and navigate to *Terraform Cloud Business Insights (TFBI)* Dashboard

> Note: It's recommended to create a Grafana user/password and login using it, otherwise you'll continue receiving auth warning logs in Grafana.

> Note: You can also access Prometheus on http://localhost:9090 to explore the collected metrics. 


## Local Development & Contribution

There is a development docker compose file (`docker-compose.dev.yml`) that makes it easier to do active development with hot-reload that takes care of rebuilding the `tfbi-exporter` binary. You can spin up the stack for local development by running the following. Any time you change and save the code it will rebuild the binary and restart the process (without rebuilding the docker image) making it easier to do active local development.

```
$  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

## Credits

Shoutout to [Kaisen Dorks](https://github.com/kaizendorks) for developing [terraform-cloud-exporter](https://github.com/kaizendorks/terraform-cloud-exporter) which I leveraged as the basis for developing TFBI. Much of the scaffloding/structure I leveraged in TFBI is based on their work, and for that I'd like to thank them.
